# Backend basics

Backend: Logic + data + APIs behind a website/app

Responsibilities of a backend server:
- Receive HTTP requests from clients
- Process logic (auth, validation, business etc)
- Talk to databases or external APIs
- Return responses (JSON/HTML/files)

Flow:
Browser -> HTTP request -> Server -> Database -> Response JSON

API: Application Programming Interface. Interface / set of rules that
decide how a server should talk to clients and other servers

REST API: POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE - Used by backends
